# Unit 2 - Store Management Project

## Introduction

You are opening a new business in your community! Businesses often need programs to manage the products and services they offer and track orders and requests from customers. Your goal is to create a store management system for your business.

## Requirements

Use your knowledge of object-oriented programming and class structure and design to create your store management system:
- **Create a class hierarchy** – Develop a superclass that represents a product or service your business offers and one or more subclasses that extend the superclass to represent more specific types of products or services.
- **Declare instance variables** – Declare instance variables in the superclass that are shared with the subclasses and instance variables in the subclasses that are not shared with the superclass.
- **Write constructors** – Write no-argument and parameterized constructors in the superclass and subclasses. Subclass constructors use the super keyword to call the superclass constructor.
- **Implement accessor and mutator methods** – Write accessor and mutator methods for instance variables that should be accessible and/or modifiable from outside of the class.
- **Implement a toString() method** – Write toString() methods in the superclass and subclasses that return information about the state of an object.

## Description

In this project, students used their knowledge in java to create a store in which they could sell goods or services of their choice. I made a Toy Animal Shop where the code will use the user input, variables, and constructor methods to help decide what item the shopper will get. An object is instantiated depending on what type of toy animal they wish to purchase. They will answer questions concerning the customizations of this animal such as its size, color, type, etc. The program will take in this user input and print the item and item details at the end of the order. The program will also print example subclasses and superclasses.
